        In a world of back-to-back meetings, hellish commutes, and cramped workspaces, we have normalized serious issues like burnout, depression, and anxiety.

Our reasons? Productivity and hustle. But the irony—it’s precisely by taking care of our minds that we become manifold effective and keep burnout at bay. To quote Psychology Today,

“There are both physical and psychological benefits of leisure time, with reduced levels of stress, anxiety, and depression; improved mood; and higher levels of positive emotion. They also lower cortisol levels, blood pressure, and heart rate.”
I want to share 5 such activities — but unlike the cliché ones, I won’t tell you to meditate or stroll. I’ll give you rarely-talked-about ones.

Sinking Into Your Chair and Relishing the Setting Sun

There’s something soul-stirring about the orange sun receding into the horizon — the setting of the mighty burning gas ball signals closure and reminds you to rest.

Add a lean-back chair into the mix and you’ve got a treat. Whenever I shut my laptop and relish this, time screeches to a standstill — peace, calm, and the ever-present beauty of the present.

As my solar buddy disappears and I return to work, I brim with positivity, focus, and energy.

        Reinvention often comes in spurts, after a long period of silence. Just as modern architecture recently enjoyed a comeback, brand architecture, a field with well-established principles for decades, is back in the limelight.

Simply understood, brand architecture is the art and science of structuring the portfolio to meet your strategic goals, defining the brand number, scope, and relationships needed to compete. Just as Modern Architecture prioritized function, a Brand Architecture is only as good as it is well-suited for the purpose it strives to achieve. Given the disruption observed today across industries and segments, it’s no wonder that companies are considering structural rather than topical solutions to the challenges they face.

Yet the context in which brand architecture decisions are being made has changed. Gone are the days of “competitive strategy”, with the military-inspired view of competition as a zero-sum game, where market share needs to be stolen from competitors, often in a street-by-street battle to win over each individual segment. The type of brand architecture required to win in this game demanded a dogged focus on each segment, and a sniper-like collection of individual brands sharply focused on each one. While there was always a place for a variety of architectures — see Joachimsthaler’s brand relationship spectrum — houses of brands were favored, as it enabled segment-by-segment competition and risk protection. P&G was the king of houses of brands, slicing and dicing the market not just by products and demographics, but also by psychographics, price range, buying patterns or attitudes. In B2B, houses of brands were omnipresent, with a product-driven logic that led to branding new features meant to provide short-term competitive advantage.

In today’s day and age, companies like Google or Amazon do not pursue growth through incremental market share gains; rather, they focus on understanding their customers’ needs and creating entirely new markets to answer them. Creating a house of brands for these markets would be folly — not only would each brand need to be created from scratch, increasing the already significant investment, but the new category itself often needs to be explained to consumers, compounding the cost.

Instead, investing in a strong master brand-led architecture and putting multiple if not all brands under the leadership of a strong brand, presents numerous advantages. First, mergers and acquisitions, or partnerships, are making it necessary to bring multiple market participants to “the same page” — and this common ground often involves a master brand recognized by all. Second, the risk profile of a “branded house” architecture has changed: the master brand can create an aura of innovation and risk-taking, supporting the launch of new products. Third, investments can be streamlined, as a strong master brand can be leveraged across markets and product launches. Finally, a track record of success in creating new categories can create goodwill, creating a virtual circle of success. To achieve this, brand architecture does not need to be a pure “branded house” — in many cases, a strong master brand creates substantial leverage and a much cleaner portfolio, even as a few particularly strong brands can continue existing as sub-brands. An example of this is Salesforce, that leverages its master brand consistently — yet allows more independence to a few specific sub-brands, such as Pardot.

There are 3 key imperatives to build this type of brand architecture — to be clear, meaningful and stretchable.

Clear: Just as modern architecture thrives on clear and clean lines, so does brand architecture. In the age of micro-segmentation, micro-targeting, information overload and digital fragmentation, you need a clear and loud voice in order to stand out. In the context of short attention spans where specific moments and needstates need to be targeted in addition to consumer/customer profiles, multiple brands often lead to confusion. The technology space understood this early, where clear and simple architectures that bring together simple design, as Apple, with complex technology, as SAP — always under the discipline of a rigorously simple way to organize.

In addition, one of the key reasons for the regained popularity of clean, streamlined architectures, often organized around a single master brand, has been the emergence of platforms, or 2-way marketplaces structured around mutual value creation. By definition, bringing various stakeholder groups to one platform requires building a single brand, in order to enable network effects so critical for building scale. As Uber expands into different marketplaces and “uberizes” different industries, leveraging the power of its master brand is likely to lead to faster expansion than building a targeted brand for each industry from scratch.

Meaningful: Just as modern architecture prioritizes function over embellishments, a solid brand architecture is founded on brands and values meaningful to consumers (or customers), rather than product feature distinctions. Brand architecture needs to be re-organized around brands that have a “reason for being” compelling enough to elicit passion, and introducing a clear distinction between brands that merit air time with consumers vs. “clutter”. The “decluttering” trend is gaining traction in brand architecture — just as in the popular consumer “decluttering” technique, only brands that “bring joy” to consumers get the spotlight. TED, for example, leverages the powerful TED master brand, positioned around “ideas worth spreading”, in a set of sub-brands that target meaningful occasions and contexts for intellectual exploration (TED Talks, TEDx, TED-Ed, TED Prize, TED Fellows, TED Institute, TED Radio Hour).

Stretchable: Modern architecture is dynamic — it finds its force in the midst of usage; movement is often embedded into its very bones. In today’s fast-changing world, brand architecture is a moving target — clients increasingly ask to design architectures that fit their growth ambitions, thinking through future growth scenarios and architecting space for the future product pipeline. In particular in industries undergoing disruption, where next generation products aim to upset the status quo, their addition to any brand architecture may require a fundamental rethink.

Much as strategy has become “real time” as the window for strategic planning has shortened, brand architecture is also becoming more “real time”, requiring more frequent reassessment, adaptations and flexibility as markets change. Witness the frequency with which Uber readjusts its portfolio. WeWork, the popular co-working space, also exploits the strength of the master brand to stretch into near-in categories such as hospitality with WeLive or the ventures space with WeWork Labs.

Traditionally, companies considered a house of brands architecture as a risk management tool — a way not to put all your eggs in one basket. It turns out, in the age of platforms and digital disruption, a masterbrand-led architecture can help you build a bigger basket, to hold more eggs.

        In a recently published paper (February 2022), researchers probed what it means to experience meaning in life. In their first study, they analyzed past survey data from over 11,000 people across 30 countries. These surveys were originally designed to assess coping strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic, but the researchers plucked out individual questions linked to meaning-in-life constructs. Here’s an example for each construct; participants had to rate their agreement with each statement or question below:

Coherence: “I’ve been looking for something good in what is happening”
Purpose: “I do something productive every day”
Mattering: “I’m doing what is good for our society”
Experiential appreciation: “I appreciate my life as it is right now regardless of the circumstances”
Meaning in life: “In general, to what extent do you feel that what you do in your life is valuable and worthwhile?”
The researchers analyzed the survey data, testing how each construct predicted people’s scores in the overall meaning-in-life measure. Consistent with previous research, the three traditional constructs (coherence, purpose, and mattering) all individually predicted meaning in life to some extent. The interesting part was that after accounting for those three constructs, the new fourth construct of experiential appreciation explained another significant portion of people’s meaning in life. In other words, a major ingredient in the meaning-in-life formula had been missed by previous researchers.

In a second study, the researchers developed their own way to measure experiential appreciation. For the three older constructs, they pulled specialized survey questions from previously published studies. But since experiential appreciation was a newcomer, they had to formalize its meaning and how to measure it. After some careful analysis, they ended up with five survey items. Anyone who scores highly on these items is high in experiential appreciation:

“I have great appreciation for the beauty of life.”
“I take great interest in my daily activities.”
“I appreciate a wide variety of experiences.”
“I appreciate the little things in life.”
“I tend to find myself deeply engaged in conversations with other people.”
Using these new measures together with the standard measures for the other three constructs, the researchers sent surveys to over 1500 people in the US and China. Instead of relying on indirect questions as they did in the previous COVID survey analysis, they collected dedicated data using well-tested measures for each construct.`

        Sourdough bread is a culinary delight cherished by bread enthusiasts worldwide. Its distinctive tangy flavor, chewy texture, and crispy crust make it stand out from ordinary bread. If you're looking to master the art of making sourdough at home, here are some essential tips and techniques to follow:

        1. Starter Care: A healthy sourdough starter is the heart of great sourdough bread. Feed your starter regularly with equal parts of flour and water to keep it active and bubbly. Adjust the feeding schedule based on room temperature and the activity of your starter.

        2. Autolyse: Autolyse is a resting period that allows flour and water to hydrate before adding the starter and salt. Mix flour and water in your recipe and let them rest for about 30 minutes. This enhances gluten development and improves the dough's extensibility.

        3. Stretch and Fold: Instead of traditional kneading, use the stretch and fold method to develop gluten in your dough. Perform a series of stretch and fold actions during the bulk fermentation stage, typically every 30 minutes for a few hours.

        4. Bulk Fermentation: Allow your dough to ferment at room temperature for several hours until it increases in volume and develops air pockets. The duration of bulk fermentation depends on the ambient temperature and the strength of your starter.

        5. Cold Proofing: After shaping your dough, place it in the refrigerator for an extended cold proofing period. This step enhances flavor, improves the dough's structure, and makes it easier to score.

        6. Proper Scoring: Use a sharp blade or scoring tool to make cuts on the surface of your dough before baking. Scoring allows the dough to expand during baking and creates attractive patterns on the crust.

        7. Steam Baking: Steam is essential for achieving a crispy crust. Use a Dutch oven or baking cloche to trap steam during the initial phase of baking, then remove the lid to allow browning.

        Remember, sourdough baking is a journey of experimentation and learning. Don't be discouraged by occasional failures; each bake brings new insights. With practice and patience, you'll soon be enjoying bakery-quality sourdough bread right from your oven.

        Functional training has gained popularity in recent years as fitness enthusiasts and athletes recognize its benefits for real-life movements. Unlike traditional weightlifting exercises that focus on isolated muscle groups, functional training emphasizes movements that mimic everyday activities.

        Compound exercises, such as squats, deadlifts, and lunges, are staples of functional training. These exercises engage multiple muscle groups and improve overall strength and stability. Additionally, functional training often involves using equipment like kettlebells, resistance bands, and medicine balls to add variety and challenge to workouts.

        One of the key advantages of functional training is its transferability to daily life. By training movements that we use in our routines, such as lifting groceries, carrying luggage, or picking up children, we improve our functional fitness and reduce the risk of injuries.

        Moreover, functional training can benefit athletes by enhancing their sports performance. Athletes can tailor their workouts to replicate the specific movements required in their sports, leading to improved agility, balance, and power.

        Here are some tips to incorporate functional training into your fitness routine:

        1. Focus on Movement Patterns: Identify the movements you perform regularly and incorporate exercises that mirror those patterns. For example, if you often need to push and pull objects, include pushing and pulling exercises in your workouts.

        2. Engage Core Muscles: Functional training places significant emphasis on core stability. Incorporate exercises that challenge your core, such as planks, Russian twists, and wood chops.

        3. Use Unilateral Exercises: Unilateral exercises, which involve one limb at a time, can help correct muscle imbalances and improve coordination. Single-leg squats and one-arm rows are excellent unilateral exercises.

        4. Maintain Proper Form: Pay close attention to your form during functional exercises to prevent injuries and get the most out of your workouts.

        Whether you're an athlete seeking to enhance sports performance or an individual looking to improve everyday movements, functional training can be a valuable addition to your fitness routine. Embrace the versatility and effectiveness of functional exercises to build functional strength and improve overall well-being.

        As global awareness about environmental issues grows, more people are striving to adopt sustainable practices in their daily lives. Sustainable living involves making conscious choices to reduce our ecological footprint and preserve the planet for future generations. Here are some small but impactful steps you can take towards a greener future:

        1. Reduce Single-Use Plastics: Carry reusable bags, water bottles, and coffee cups to avoid disposable plastic items. These simple switches can significantly reduce plastic waste that ends up in landfills and oceans.

        2. Conserve Energy: Turn off lights, appliances, and electronics when not in use. Replace traditional incandescent bulbs with energy-efficient LED lights, and consider using a programmable thermostat to optimize energy consumption.

        3. Choose Sustainable Transportation: Whenever possible, opt for walking, cycling, or public transportation to reduce carbon emissions. If you need a car, consider investing in an electric or hybrid vehicle.

        4. Support Local and Organic Products: Purchase locally grown and organic food items to support sustainable farming practices and reduce the carbon footprint of transportation.

        5. Practice Water Conservation: Fix leaks and install water-saving fixtures in your home. Additionally, use water wisely by taking shorter showers and watering plants in the early morning or late evening to reduce evaporation.

        6. Recycle and Compost: Separate recyclable materials from your regular trash and compost food scraps to divert waste from landfills.

        7. Embrace Minimalism: Consume mindfully and avoid unnecessary purchases. Choose quality over quantity and opt for products with minimal packaging.

        8. Plant Trees and Gardens: Trees absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen, making them essential in the fight against climate change. Start a small garden at home to grow your fruits and vegetables sustainably.

        9. Educate and Advocate: Raise awareness about environmental issues among your friends and family. Participate in local environmental initiatives and advocate for sustainable practices in your community.

        Sustainable living is a collective effort, and every small action can make a difference. By adopting eco-friendly habits and inspiring others to do the same, we can create a greener and more sustainable future for generations to come.

        Landscape photography allows us to immortalize the breathtaking beauty of nature and create lasting memories of our journeys. Whether you're an amateur photographer or a seasoned pro, here are some tips to help you capture stunning landscape photos:

        1. Plan Your Shoot: Research the location you intend to photograph and check the weather conditions. Knowing the sunrise and sunset times can help you capture magical golden hour shots.

        2. Use a Tripod: A sturdy tripod is essential for keeping your camera steady and capturing sharp images, especially in low light conditions.

        3. Pay Attention to Composition: Follow the rule of thirds and frame your shots with interesting foreground elements to create depth and lead the viewer's eye into the scene.

        4. Use Filters: Graduated neutral density (ND) filters can help balance the exposure between the sky and the landscape, while polarizing filters reduce glare and enhance colors.

        5. Embrace Golden Hour and Blue Hour: The hour after sunrise and before sunset (golden hour) and the hour after sunset and before sunrise (blue hour) offer soft, warm light ideal for landscape photography.

        6. Capture Motion: Experiment with long exposure shots to capture the movement of water or clouds. Using a slow shutter speed can create a dreamy and ethereal effect.

        7. Focus on Details: While capturing wide-angle vistas is essential, don't forget to zoom in and photograph intricate details like patterns in rocks or textures in tree bark.

        8. Wait for the Right Moment: Patience is key in landscape photography. Wait for the right light and weather conditions to capture the scene at its best.

        9. Post-Processing: Use editing software to enhance your images subtly. Adjusting exposure, contrast, and color balance can make your photos even more captivating.

        10. Practice and Experiment: Landscape photography is an art that improves with practice. Experiment with different techniques and learn from your mistakes.

        Remember, landscape photography is not just about capturing beautiful images but also about immersing yourself in the beauty of nature. Take time to appreciate the scenery and connect with the environment to create meaningful and evocative photographs.
